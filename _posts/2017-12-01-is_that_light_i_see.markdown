Moving into Sinatra with the utmost confidence! So far I am really enjoying what Sinatra has to offer. It is SO mind blowing that we as programmers can take a software like Sinatra and make pretty little nothings into pretty little web applications!

# Thank you Blake Mizerany!
Let us just take a moment to reflect on how lucky us programmers are for being given a light weight framework. Thus far, ERB templating is really interesting and fun to work with, although I still need to brush up on ERB tags. While working on the Sinatra-Views-Lab I found myself having trouble understanding/translating the following line of code. ——-> 

`<p>The date is <%= Date.today.strftime("%A, %B %d, %Y") %></p>`

I felt like the previous lessons in Sinatra didn’t prepare me enough to understand this is great detail butttt that is what Google is for, and as my journey at Flatiron continues I am learning that a monumental part of learning is not knowing the answer and searching for it. There is such a great deal of please it that! Excited for what is yet to come!
