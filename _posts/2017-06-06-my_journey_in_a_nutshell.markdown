It has been a long one, that's for sure! I started to have an interest for coding at a young age, but just didn't realize how much of an interest until just recently. Prior to enrolling in the Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development Program, I retrieved my Bachelors in Interpersonal/Organization Communications from University of Central Florida in 2013. With this degree, I planned on excelling in the Hospitality industry. After working in the industry for quite some time, I came to the conclusion that I wasn't satisfied. Being 27, this was a scary thought! I'm thinking to myself "I HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN!" I than began to brainstorm thoughts like, "What do I enjoy doing?" and , "What skills can I obtain that will benefit me in the long run?" These thoughts led me to CODING! This is kinda cheesy but, do you remember wanting to change your MySpace layout? I sure do, and guess what?, thats all code! I remember oddly enjoying sitting there for hours writing code to construct my MySpace page. With this thought in mind, I then started to research my options for continued education in Web Development. I didn't waste any time! I immediately began my coding journey by signing up for a Web Development certificate with an online school called SkillCrush, which I then completed. After completion, I was left with wanting more! After more research, I discovered // Flatiron School. At first glance, I was intrigued. I knew at that moment wanted to take part in the Flatiron community. I quickly applied for a spot in the Online Web Development program with the Women Take Tech Scholarship. I think you can figure out the rest from here :) 

I'm excited for what is yet to come!
Happy Coding!

XOXO, 
Lauren
