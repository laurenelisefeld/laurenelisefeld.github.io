I have definitely been slacking on completing and updating my blog posts, but here I am coming in full force with another update! Wow, coding is no joke. As I enter into my Music Library CLI project, I reflect on all things Ruby. Right off the bat, I can say with confidence that I enjoy Front End Development more than Back End(not saying this is permanent). When I started my Learn journey, I had set certain expectations for myself. I had a specific duration of time for completing the course in mind, but as I continued my journey, I've come to realize....THIS IS NOT A RACE! I find myself often getting frustrated because some topics take me longer than others to comprehend. I constantly have to remind myself that I am not alone. Does anyone else feel like some of the material is never going to click? We all have a choice, we can either look at the glass half empty, or half full. I have chosen to look at the glass half full and have full confidence in myself that I can and I will becoming an experience programer with time. Key word -- TIME. If you are feeling about ever giving up, just know you are not alone. We are all in this together.
